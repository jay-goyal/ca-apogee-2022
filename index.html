                I began working as a Campus Ambassador (CA) when I was in Third
                year. I first worked an Open Day and after that, I was hooked!
                The work is varied which keeps it interesting, from campus tours
                to sign in desks and setting up for events, it helped me develop
                lots of skills which I'm sure I will use in my future career.
                It's also great that you can fit the work in around your college
                schedule and make use of hours off in college to earn some extra
                skills! The work was always good fun because you were with other
                people. I met lots of great people while working in the role,
                both staff, students, the public and the odd celebrity,
                professors too(in virtual mode) which I would have never met,
                had I not been a CA. For me, working as a CA is all about the
                people. I would encourage anyone that likes meeting new people,
                is friendly and helpful to apply for a role as an CA.
