                            <p>The primary task of every Campus Ambassador is to ensure maximum participation from their college. The efforts of the Campus Ambassador in this direction will be judged by a referral code system, with each Campus Ambassadors referral code being his/her name as mentioned during registration.</p>
                            <p>Points Allocation for Registration: 100 points per participant.Until APOGEE, this will be monitored on the basis of number of registrations on the website. However, after APOGEE, the points from this will be revised based on the number of students who attended APOGEE.</p>
                            <p>We strongly advise you to ensure that your referral code is advertised well, and everyone is requested to mention your name in the referred by field in the registration form, otherwise your efforts will not be translated into points on the leaderboard.</p>
